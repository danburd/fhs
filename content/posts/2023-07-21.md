The Fairlington Historical Society has launched a new website that's **Informative**, **fast**, and **cheap**.

- **Informative**: The site's content is completely up-to-date...
- **Fast**: The site is very fast. Pages load almost instantly and use minimal resources. The new site won't spin up your laptop fan or burn though your mobile data cap.
- **Cheap**: The site costs nothing to host. We also changed domain registrars; together, the two changes will result in significant savings for FHS.

For those interested in technical details, the new website runs on [Hugo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_(software)), a static site generator. It's uploaded to Github and hosted on Cloudflare Pages.
