The Fairlington Historical Society (FHS) is an organization of Fairlingtonians, present and past, devoted to preserving the unique legacy of the community.

Organized in 2000, the FHS succeeded the Fairlington Historic Designation Committee, which had pursued and achieved Historic District status for Fairlington and placement on the Virginia Landmarks Register (December 1998) and on the National Register of Historic Places (March 1999). The forms used for those historic designations are below:

- [Registration Form](files/Nomform2.pdf)
- [Summary Form](files/Nomtext2.pdf)

The FHS is governed by a Board of Trustees. Our goals encompass a range of community, education, preservation, and publication work.

The Society was granted exemption under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code by the Internal Revenue Service on September 18, 2000, and was registered with the Commonwealth of Virginia under Section 57-49 of the Virginia Solicitation of Contributions Law on June 27, 2001. All contributions are tax deductible to the full extent of
the law.

All FHS projects and activities are organized and undertaken by volunteers. Contact Us to volunteer.
